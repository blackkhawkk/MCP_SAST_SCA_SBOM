# OWASP Juice Shop Security Analysis Report

**Analysis Date:** July 14, 2025  
**Analyzer:** Simple Security Analyzer (Python)  
**Project:** OWASP Juice Shop v18.0.0  

## Executive Summary

The security analysis of OWASP Juice Shop revealed **significant security concerns** with a **maximum risk score of 10/10**. This is expected as Juice Shop is intentionally designed to be vulnerable for educational purposes.

### Key Findings

| Category | Count | Severity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Dependencies** | 145 total | 69 production, 76 development |
| **Secrets Found** | 62 | 61 high, 1 medium |
| **Code Issues** | 1,974 | Multiple categories |
| **SBOM Files** | 2 | bom.json (779 components), bom.xml |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- **Total Dependencies:** 145 packages
- **Production Dependencies:** 69
- **Development Dependencies:** 76
- **SBOM Coverage:** Complete with CycloneDX format (779 components tracked)

### 2. Secrets Scanning Results
- **Critical Finding:** 61 high-severity secret exposures detected
- **Primary Issues:** AWS secret keys found in configuration files
- **Affected Files:** Primarily `config/*.yml` files
- **Risk Level:** HIGH - Hardcoded secrets in version control

### 3. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Total Issues:** 1,974 security patterns detected
- **High Risk Patterns:** SQL injection, command injection, eval usage
- **Medium Risk:** XSS vulnerabilities, path traversal
- **Low Risk:** Console logging, TODO comments

### 4. Infrastructure Analysis
- **Container Support:** Docker configuration present
- **Configuration Management:** Multiple environment configs
- **Deployment:** Express.js application with standard security middleware

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Score: 10/10 (Maximum)

**Contributing Factors:**
- High volume of hardcoded secrets (61 high-severity)
- Extensive use of vulnerable code patterns (1,974 findings)
- Large dependency surface area (145 packages)
- Intentionally insecure design (educational purpose)

## Priority Recommendations

### ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Secrets Management**
   - **Issue:** 62 hardcoded secrets found in configuration files
   - **Action:** Remove all hardcoded secrets and implement environment variables or secret management systems
   - **Impact:** Prevents credential exposure and unauthorized access

2. **Code Security Remediation**
   - **Issue:** 1,974 security issues including SQL injection and command injection patterns
   - **Action:** Review and fix high-risk security patterns
   - **Impact:** Eliminates critical vulnerability vectors

### ðŸ”¶ MEDIUM PRIORITY

3. **Dependency Management**
   - **Issue:** 145 dependencies create large attack surface
   - **Action:** Implement automated dependency scanning (npm audit, Snyk)
   - **Impact:** Reduces third-party vulnerability exposure

4. **Security Process Integration**
   - **Issue:** No automated security scanning in development workflow
   - **Action:** Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipeline
   - **Impact:** Prevents security issues from reaching production

### ðŸ”µ LOW PRIORITY

5. **Security Monitoring**
   - **Issue:** Limited security monitoring capabilities
   - **Action:** Implement security monitoring and logging
   - **Impact:** Improves incident detection and response

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) Analysis

### Current SBOM Status
- **Format:** CycloneDX (JSON & XML)
- **Components Tracked:** 779 total components
- **Last Updated:** June 16, 2025
- **Tool Used:** @cyclonedx/npm v3.1.0

### SBOM Completeness
- âœ… Production dependencies fully tracked
- âœ… Development dependencies included
- âœ… License information captured
- âœ… Vulnerability metadata ready

## Compliance Assessment

### OWASP Top 10 Mapping
- **A01 - Broken Access Control:** Multiple findings
- **A02 - Cryptographic Failures:** Secret exposure issues
- **A03 - Injection:** SQL injection patterns detected
- **A06 - Vulnerable Components:** Large dependency footprint
- **A09 - Security Logging:** Limited monitoring detected

### Remediation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Critical Security (Immediate)
1. Remove hardcoded secrets from all configuration files
2. Implement environment variable management
3. Address high-risk SAST findings (SQL injection, command injection)

#### Phase 2: Security Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
1. Set up automated dependency scanning
2. Integrate security testing in CI/CD
3. Implement secret scanning in pipeline

#### Phase 3: Security Operations (1 month)
1. Deploy security monitoring
2. Establish incident response procedures
3. Regular security assessments

## Technical Details

### Analysis Tools Used
- **Python-based Security Scanner:** Custom regex patterns and dependency analysis
- **SBOM Parser:** CycloneDX format analysis
- **Pattern Matching:** 8 security pattern categories
- **File Coverage:** TypeScript, JavaScript, YAML, JSON configuration files

### Files Analyzed
- Source code: `*.ts`, `*.js` files (excluding node_modules)
- Configuration: `config/*.yml`, `*.json` files
- Package management: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- SBOM files: `bom.json`, `bom.xml`
